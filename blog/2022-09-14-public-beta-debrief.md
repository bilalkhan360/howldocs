If you took part in our Beta test, then thank you!

Without all our testers, getting to mainnet would be taking us a lot longer.

We were blown away by the scale of response - thanks to everybody that had feedback, feature suggestions or helped out in some way.

Again, like last time, we have some numbers.

- 9.42k unique users took part in the testnet
- 1,538,091 HOWLx (testnet HOWL) was claimed
- All our documentation challenges were completed

However, this time there were also some snags - which makes sense, as we get closer to mainnet.

- 2 severity 1 bugs
- 8 minor bugs

## What's next - the road to mainnet

So what does this mean?

Well, we have some windows to mend, and then we will run either a closed Beta2 net, or a final open test before we go to mainnet.

This has pushed our timings back by a couple of weeks, but not by a massive amount.

Thanks to everybody for their interest in the project and we'll have more updates soon!
